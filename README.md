#Year2 Assignment 1 - University Paper Offering System


You are asked to write a program in Java to simulate a University Paper Offering System

Mmajorse: Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), Information Systems (IS), Software Engineering (SE), and Data Science (DS).

Each paper offered belongs to one or more majors and has a paper number (such as 159234) and a name. 
Each paper may include up to three assessment types (tests, assignments, exam), and each assessment type carries a particular weighting. 
Each paper is offered in all three of the following modes: internal Auckland, internal Palmerston North (PN), and distance. Each mode must be delivered by one lecturer.

Each lecturer is located at one of two campuses (Auckland or PN). A lecturer can only deliver an internal offering if it is located on his/her campus – but can deliver any distance offering. 
Each lecturer may deliver a minimum of zero offerings and a maximum of four offerings. Each lecturer’s biographical details (first name, last name, ID number, and campus) must be recorded.
